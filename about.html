            <p>There are definitely a few athletes who are overly analytical about their training. A log book
                can be
                cluttered with too much analysis and detail. Be careful of this! The classic saying, "Paralysis
                by
                analysis" is to be avoided if possible! Remember the primary reason you are training is
                for enjoyment and relaxation, and of course for the results. Use this journal with these central
                feelings in mind, so the journal does not get you bogged down.</p>
